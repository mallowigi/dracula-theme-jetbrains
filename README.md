# Dracula Theme for Jetbrains

This is a port of the [Dracula Theme](http://www.draculatheme.com) theme for the [Material Theme UI plugin](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains)
exporting the color schemes AND the UI Theme thanks to the [Bundled Themes feature](http://www.material-theme.com/docs/configuration/settings/#bundled-themes).

## Installation

To install the plugin:
1. Open your Jetbrains favorite editor.
2. Go to Settings > Plugins
3. Select "Browse repositories" and search "Dracula theme".
4. This plugin depends on the [Material Theme UI plugin](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) to be installed, so install this one if not already installed.
5. Restart the IDE.
6. If you aren't familiar with the Material Theme plugin, you need to select the Dracula theme from the [Theme Switcher](http://www.material-theme.com/docs/configuration/settings/#theme-switcher).
It's inside the _External Themes_ option on the list.
7. Enjoy!

## Notes
- The plugin not only gives the UI Theme but the Color Scheme as well from [the Dracula repository](https://github.com/dracula/jetbrains/tree/624c7a4210b542feeeb04ee1f7bcad8e1b6f00dd). I'm not maintaining it.
- Do not confond with D**ar**cula!
- The plugin is available from 2018.1 and above only.
